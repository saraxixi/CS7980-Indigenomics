There she is — on the cover of Fashion magazine; nominated for Model of the Year at the Canadian Arts and Fashion awards; modelling a swimsuit in Sports Illustrated. “It’s not really showing what I overcame to get there or how I grew up or what I went through emotionally, mentally, to be who I am today,” Ashley explains, when I finally catch up to her on Zoom. It’s 7 a.m. in Vancouver, where she’s now living, and even though she’s not glammed up, she oozes poise and professionalism. Fifteen years ago, well before she was a pageant queen, I met a much younger, less polished version of Ashley. As part of a non-profit initiative, I’d invited Indigenous leaders to meet, to talk about the trauma of youth suicides. Ashley shared her perspective alongside others, including Sen. Patrick Brazeau and Dr. Alika Lafontaine (later, named the first Indigenous president of the Canadian Medical Association). Then, Ashley was able to speak clearly — not only about the horrors of growing up on reserve sexually abused by her mother’s boyfriend, but as well, of her resolve to walk the Red Road, the spiritual way of life, not drinking or doing drugs. Today, she is even stronger: “My culture, really, was the one thing that kept me grounded. I think I needed something to keep me on the right path, and having grandparents who were a medicine man and medicine woman, that really helped me a lot.” Get a dash of perspective along with the trending news of the day in a very readable format.

Don’t expect to find a saviour in her story. “Healing has to start from within the community,” she asserts. A lot of people have what she calls a “rez” mentality: “They can’t think past the reserve because that’s their level of comfort. A lot of people are afraid to step out of their comfort zone because we were told we don’t belong in those spaces. “A lot of times, people depend on the government to come and save us,” she continues, “but the government was a system that was created, you know, not for us, but against us. So for me, I’m not gonna wait for anybody to come save me. I’m gonna have to save myself.” When Ashley won the Mrs. Universe title in 2015, she used her fame to campaign for missing and murdered Indigenous women. And she was hopeful for the possibility of change. Nine years later, she’s disappointed by a prime minister who doesn’t walk the talk. “He (Justin Trudeau) takes selfies,” she laments, “and to me, that’s like checking a box that you were there. But where’s the impact? What has been changed? Why would we choose you again? “It makes me sad,” she says, “because I feel like there should be more women and more Indigenous people in politics.” We talk of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s truncated tenure in politics. Trudeau made all these promises to act, but how many have been implemented, she asks. “Not even a handful,” Ashley scoffs, answering her own question. “A lot of things have not been changed,” Ashley concludes, “Our people are still suffering, our people are still fighting, and it’s really sad, because we have to do our healing within our own communities … A lot of us rely on the government to help us, but they’re not there to help us.” Being Indigenous and female is replete with stereotypes, but, I wonder, how does Ashley deal with hackneyed notions about beauty pageants? From 1996 to 2015, Donald Trump owned the Miss Universe organization — and he didn’t hide his ambition to make money with the pageant, by commodifying beautiful women. The enterprise is now owned by a Thai media tycoon, reportedly a trans woman who aims to expand the pageant’s vision in Asia with skincare, cosmetics, drinks and lifestyle products. “Yeah,” Ashley laughs, “before I joined beauty pageants, I used to stereotype them as well, because I didn’t know them. I’m like, it’s a glamorous way for beautiful women to celebrate themselves.” But, she submits, it’s now about women with substance. “You can be the most beautiful woman in the room, but you have nothing to give. That’s what’s different now. They look for women of substance, women who have character and are actually doing something good for their community, that’s bigger than themselves. And that’s what I really like,” she concludes, “it’s giving them a platform.” Behind the scenes, the final Miss Universe competition will be gruelling. For three solid weeks, contestants will be judged by people watching their every move: what they wear, how they behave, what they say. Right now, Ashley is working with designers to get 40 outfits ready for Mexico City — rehearsal clothes, gowns, cocktail dresses, all with some type of Indigenous flair. Will she use her culture for clout? Absolutely. Unlike her former friend and mentor, Buffy Sainte-Marie, who broke Ashley’s heart when she was called out for pretending to be Indigenous, Ashley is true to her culture. But she’s not interested in simply checking a box. “A huge sports company, a broadcasting company, flew me in, gave me the whole shebang, red carpet treatment, offered me head anchor,” she reports. “When I first walked into the room; it was just all old white men,” she grimaces. “But then I said to them, I’m gonna call out the elephant in the room … and I told them point-blank, I don’t want to be your token representative. I don’t want to be filling your box of diversity, equity and inclusion.” As attractive as the job opportunity was, she declined. The company expected her to commit on an exclusive basis. “I’m more than one thing,” she told them, “I have so many dreams. You’re trying to put me in a box.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

As Canada and the U.S. focused in recent years on the “away game” of fighting terrorism in far-flung nations, Russia and China continued to target North America — and found a continent woefully unprepared for the threat, recently retired generals and other experts warned this week. At a Mackenzie Institute forum on security in the Arctic on Wednesday in Toronto, speakers argued that Canada needs to urgently boost its lagging investment in defence — or see its control of the Far North slip away to foreign adversaries.

Don't have an account?  An actual military presence in the Arctic — which makes up 40 per cent of Canada — plus transportation infrastructure and resource development that benefit local Indigenous populations are necessary to counter growing incursions by Russia, China and others, the experts said. But there’s little sign the Trudeau government is committed to giving more than lip service to such challenges, they said. An updated defence policy the Liberals released in the spring, along with promises to buy new fighter jets and submarines, is the right idea, but must actually be implemented, said retired U.S. Gen. Glen Vanherck, who until early this year commanded the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD). “I look forward to seeing those actions but there’s not a history of (Canada) taking those actions,” Vanherck said in an interview before giving the conference’s key note address. “There is no sense of urgency, for the most part, from the leadership of the government of Canada,” he said. “It is easy to say we’re going to buy F-35 (fighter jets), we’re going to buy submarines. But with that comes a lot of requirements to build infrastructure, set up logistics pipelines, set up training pipelines. And my question is, is Canada ready to do that?” Your guide to the world of Canadian politics.

Andrew Leslie, who was a Liberal MP from 2015 to 2019 after leading the Canadian Army, was less diplomatic. Alliances like NORAD and NATO are particularly important with authoritarian leaders like Russia’s Vladimir Putin “on the prowl,” but Canada’s part in those groups is “sorely lacking,” he said. “You have to contribute your fair share and, quite frankly, Canada, over the last nine to 10 years, has not done so,” said Leslie. “There’s one issue that seems to galvanize and unify (U.S.) Republicans and Democrats, both in the House of Representatives and the Senate. That is their concern and dismay over Canada’s paltry contributions to international peace and security and the unacceptable — and I’ll use that word again, unacceptable — levels of money spent on defence capability.” The Army is short 16,000 personnel, he added, while “70 per cent of the army’s vehicles don’t work because they’re either waiting for spare parts or they don’t have the mechanics to fix them. Half our Navy’s fleet, their ships can’t actually set sail because they don’t have the sailors or the spare parts to get them out of port.” The Conservatives do not have a much better record on supporting the military, suggested Leona Alleslev, a former MP who crossed the floor from the Liberals to the Tories. That means that Canadian citizens, companies and think tanks need to push for “nation building” in the North to help protect it, said Alleslev, a former air force officer. The conference centred around concerns that as climate change makes the Arctic more navigable for ships, countries such as Russia — which has recently rebuilt numerous Arctic bases — and China — which declares itself a “near-arctic” nation despite being thousands of kilometres away — are sending increasing numbers of military vessels and aircraft into the region. Those incursions are part of broader attempts by those adversaries to challenge North America, some speakers said. The 9/11 attacks led to an emphasis on the “away game” — fighting terrorists and other enemies overseas to ensure they don’t become a bigger threat at home, said retired Major-Gen. Scott Clancy, who was director of operations for NORAD until 2021. The U.S. Defense Department “is focused on fighting the away game, hamstringing the commander of NORAD, U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and belying the vulnerability of our homeland,” Clancy said. “As the Middle East missions evolved — ISIS, al-Qaida, the Taliban, whatever it was — Russia began flexing its muscles with each and every incursion into the air defence identification zones of Canada and the United States. They approach our coastlines from all sides. They still do. And the most recent incursions … include Chinese aircraft along with them. I have long said, where you see the intersection of Russian and Chinese interests, especially in military co-operation, we should be worried.” While Russian planes can get to U.S. airspace in Alaska within about half an hour, it would take the nearest F-22 Raptor, an American fighter jet, two hours to get to the same spot at full speed, he said. Vanherck, Clancy’s former boss at NORAD, echoed his warnings, saying the notion that Russia is a “paper tiger” because of its slog of a war in Ukraine is misguided. “In my three and a half years in command of NORAD and NORTHCOM, what I saw was exactly the opposite,” he said. “Strategically, they deployed more, they deployed more bombers, they deployed more submarines … They’re still very capable, with the world’s largest nuclear arsenal and hypersonic weapons.” That said, speakers argued that it’s unlikely Russia or China would actually try to invade the Canadian Arctic, or otherwise attack North America. Their goal is more to impose themselves in the region with resource development and infrastructure like ports and roads, they said. There are reports of Indigenous organizations and other authorities in the North, for instance, being offered major funding from Chinese interests, said Brian Hay, the Mackenzie president. “The actions that are ongoing are for influence — Russian influence, Chinese influence,” said Vanherck. “They’re seeking to change international law norms, get after resources through claims that put them in a better position globally, economically, diplomatically, than they are today. … This is about influence and changing the world order.” Russia at least purports to want peace in the region because of its ambitions to exploit the Arctic economically, said Alison LeClaire, Canada’s ambassador to Moscow from 2020 to 2023, and its top Arctic official before that. Already, the country derives as much as 20 per cent of its gross domestic product from Arctic development, she said, compared to less than one per cent in Canada. “The reality is that everybody wants into the Arctic, and it’s ours to protect,” she said. “We need to stand up for ourselves and be present.” National Post Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

In a 2021   for Tablet magazine, “A Light for the Indigenous Nations” (Israel being the “light”), Trotter enlarged on the parallels that exist between her own and the Jews’ claim to indigeneity. While conceding that there is no universally recognized definition of indigeneity, Trotter points to benchmarks that are generally accepted, most crucially “self-identification; historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies; strong links to territories and surrounding natural resources; distinct social, economic, or political systems; distinct language, culture, and beliefs,” all criteria, she stated, that the Jewish people fulfil. Maoris find connections to Jewish culture in their own traditions of geneology-reading and references to ancestor burials. In particular, Trotter cites Jews’ attachment to Jerusalem and its surrounding mountains as analogous to the deep ties of Maori to their own sacred mountains.

Please try again Jews’ continuous presence in the land of Israel for well over 3,000 years, Trotter writes, “affirms their ‘mana whenua’ or historic right to the land.” The Israeli immersion language school system — “ulpan” — created for the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language even serves as a model for the “kohanga reo,” Maori language preschools. Trotter firmly rejects the colonialist narrative that dominates Indigenous discourse in Canada around Israel which, she correctly notes, “had its genesis in academic and has filtered down to politics and media, then promoted by historians of settler colonialism. According to this narrative, Israel is the archetypal intruder.” Settler colonialism, she insists, is the “wrong framework” for understanding Israel’s history. Trotter sensibly points out that “If an ethnic group like the Arabs (indigenous to Arabia) — who colonized Israel in the sixth century and imposed their language and religion on the conquered peoples — can claim indigeneity based on long-standing presence, then so can other colonizing groups. The rights and status of all indigenous peoples would be threatened by such an approach.” On Feb. 1, one of Trotter’s cherished ambitions was realized in the launch of the   — Israel’s 100th embassy and Jerusalem’s fifth. This embassy will serve as an information hub to counter the anti-Israel narrative that Jews are foreigners in their own land, and to “galvanize” global Indigenous support for Israel. The embassy will also feature a digital product department to counter misinformation about Israel on social media. Trotter further envisages an NGO presence for the ICFI at the UN. I watched the uplifting   of the inaugural ceremony, held at Jerusalem’s  , replete with exuberant speeches from both Indigenous leaders and Israeli officials, complemented by rousing music and spontaneous dance, with many of the 200 delegates in traditional costumes. Among those in attendance were Indigenous people from Tahiti, Hawaii, Canada, the Hopi tribe in Arizona, the Arawak Taino from Puerto Rico and the Georgia Tribe of Eastern Cherokee. A ram’s horn — the “shofar” blown in synagogue on the High Holy Days — blasted in triumph. The common refrain was “We stand with you in your struggle.” In his speech, Xami Thomas, a representative from the 15-million strong Khoi people, divided into 20 or so tribes spread throughout southern Africa, including Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, raised the issue of the   against Israel his country brought before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. He apologized for “the horrible thing that the ANC (African National Congress) government did to this glorious nation. We are sorry. They do not represent all the Khoi or all the people of Southern Africa. They did not consult us and the allegations are without any substance.” Melodie Greyeyes, national director of Church’s Ministry among Jewish People, and a member of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation (Treaty Six area), was Canada’s Indigenous representative at the launch. Like so many of the other members of the ICFI, Christian belief is at the forefront of her attachment to Israel. For Melodie, Israel exemplifies a spirit of resilience she admires. “The world has pushed you (Jews) down,” she told me in a telephone interview, “but you have always risen up and overcome and declared life.” Greyeyes and her husband spent three months in Israel after the pogrom, on kitchen duty for evacuees from southern Israel at a guest house run by   in Jerusalem. The CBC is normally very keen on Indigenous people’s stories of spiritual empowerment. A politically neutral observer might think Greyeyes’s  — not to mention the larger news item of an Indigenous Embassy Jerusalem’s Jerusalem launch — would provide good CBC fodder. But if one did think that, one would be wrong. X.com: @BarbaraRKay Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

Addressing the Israeli-American Council’s annual summit in Washington, D.C., Trump joked about the advantage that Democrats enjoyed among Jews at the polls in 2016 and 2020, despite his support for the Jewish state and his daughter, son-in-law and three of his grandchildren being Jewish.

Honestly, you didn’t treat yourselves well.” Trump said polling currently showed him with support from “about 40%” of the Jewish populace. A Pew poll earlier this month showed that 34% of American Jews support Trump. “Those votes may be necessary for us to win,” he said. “I’ll put it to you very simply and as gently as I can: I wasn’t treated properly by the voters who happen to be Jewish,” he continued. “Do they know what the hell is happening? If I don’t win this election—and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens—because at 40%, that means 60% of the people voting for the enemy.” Trump said if he doesn’t win, Israel “will cease to exist within two years.” The former president mixed lines he has repeatedly used from his stump speeches with elements intended for a Jewish and Israeli audience. He cited moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and the 2020 Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries as among the pro-Israel accomplishments of his administration.

He recognized those families attending the summit and asked for them to stand up to a round of applause. He called Dedi Simchi, whose Israel Defense Forces paratrooper son Guy was killed fighting Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival, and Andrey Kozlov, who was freed from Hamas captivity in an IDF rescue mission in Gaza after eight months in captivity, up to the stage. “He’s got more courage than I have,” Trump said of Koslov. Perhaps the loudest applause of the night came when Trump said that he would deport “foreign jihad sympathizers,” as well as strip universities of their accreditation and federal funding unless their administrators put a stop to “antisemitic propaganda.” (The federal government does not directly control university accreditation but approves independent accreditation agencies.) “If you hate America, if you want to eliminate Israel, we will throw you out of our country so fast your head will spin,” he said. The organizers of Thursday’s event said more than 3,000 people were in attendance—the majority of whom seemed to be enthusiastic Trump supporters—with a strong Israeli presence. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and CEO of the American Jewish Committee Ted Deutch, previously a representative for the state of Florida, were among the elected and Jewish leaders in attendance at Thursday’s summit. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), who made a surprise late-evening appearance at the conference, noted in his brief remarks that Israel might be one of the few issues he and attendees would agree on. “Politically, I’m a Democrat, but I’m very, very, very much all about standing with Israel,” Fetterman said. “I’m known as going into red [i.e., Republican] areas and rooms or whatever, and just to talk and have a conversation. “I’m not asking ‘who are you voting for in 2024?’” he added. “Perhaps some of you are on a different ‘team’ politically, but I’m absolutely on your team, Israel.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Financial struggles were a contributing factor to the overall decline in life satisfaction, although pinpointing possible reasons is “challenging,” Statistics Canada said. More Canadians — 32.8 per cent — said they faced financial difficulties in 2024 compared to 18.6 per cent in 2021. Not surprisingly, those who did not struggle with money were more likely to report high levels of life satisfaction. Working-aged adults, racialized Canadians and persons with disabilities were most likely to have money problems from 2021 to 2024. Those who struggled said they had difficulty meeting financial needs in terms of transportation, housing, food, clothing, and other necessary expenses in the past 12 months, per Statistics Canada. Overall, hopeful feelings toward the future have been declining for Canadians. Those who took the survey were asked: “Thinking about your life in general, how often would you say you have a hopeful view of the future?” If they responded “always” or “often,” they were considered hopeful.

Or   if you have an account. On Wednesday, secondary students from the Toronto District School Board were taken on a field trip to the Grassy Narrows River Run rally. The event, which took place in downtown Toronto, was communicated to parents as an educational opportunity for the students to learn about the issue of mercury contamination affecting the First Nation. The permission slip sent home stated that, “while at the event, students will not be participating in the rally itself; instead, they will observe and learn from the presentations and discussions.” Enjoy the latest local, national and international news.

We now know from parents who have called in to speak on  , posted on social media, or spoken personally with journalists, that students taken to the event by their teachers did, in fact, participate in the event, exposing them to other activist causes, possibly endangering their safety. This should’ve been expected by the TDSB. One does not simply “observe” a rally. A concerned parent, who took video of the protest, told me that they went to the rally with their child for two reasons — they wanted to support the Grassy Narrows cause and they wanted to see if students would actually be passive observers in the rally as promised by TDSB. The parent, who asked not be named for fear of professional repercussions, had hoped this would be true, that, perhaps, alongside the rally there would be educational workshops or Q&A where students could ask questions about the unresolved mercury poisoning of the Wabigoon River system, keeping students separated from the rally itself. But the parent’s past experience with the TDSB made them highly doubtful. “What does it even mean to observe a rally, anyway?” they laughed.

Please try again According to the parent, the rally got off to a great start. All of the official speakers, according to the source, were educational, with the exception of the last speaker who, to their credit, began with a useful safety warning about following the marshal as they walked through the streets to protest, but then followed up the helpful piece of advice by reminding everyone in the crowd to only use rally-approved chants, including asking them to repeat one of them — “From Turtle Island to Palestine, occupation is a crime.” When the crowd, which included TDSB students, did not repeat the chant loud enough the first time, the speaker asked them to repeat it, the parent said. Funny. This pre-approved chant was not mentioned on the   that went home to parents. The rally had other non-Indigenous, non-Grassy Narrows related chants and imagery. Pro-Palestinian supporters were reportedly there handing out their own materials and chanting their own slogans. A video of a woman who was recorded at the rally using a megaphone to blast the pre-approved   was shared on X by concerned parents who were at the rally to support Grassy Narrows First Nation, but did not approve of the co-opting of the event by pro-Palestinian activists and any influence they might have on their children or any harm that might come to them by interacting with them. Rallies aren’t “safe spaces” for students. Students can easily get lost in crowds, or, worse, get caught up in potentially dangerous protest activities. When I questioned TDSB about whether or not student participation in the rally and their exposure to other activist groups was pre-approved or considered safe by the TDSB, they responded, via email, that they understood that “some students may have been negatively impacted by what they saw and heard,” but were “not aware that students would engage with any issues outside the main focus of River Run.” They then stated that “in general, students should not be participating in organized protests as part of a field trip,” and that they would review their “field trip procedures to provide guidance that upholds the safety and well-being of students.” Did they not have procedures before this trip? This isn’t much of an explanation, but it does tell us how much the TDSB understands about the nature of rallies. But rallies are not passive events. They are calls for communal action. The word implies participation. They are not spectator events. There’s also no guarantee that can be given by any school board that rallies will only be attended by those who care about the specific issue. I’d say it’s almost an impossibility for some causes, especially now since it’s become a tactic of the pro-Palestinian cause to attempt to align themselves with Indigenous groups, claiming to be on the same anti-settler-colonialist mission. A few questions remain about this event. Were the main organizers aware of all of the pre-approved chants? If not, and if they disagree with the inclusion of the last speaker’s chant, why was the last speaker not stopped on the stage before they had the chance to ask the crowd to repeat it? By their own admission, TDSB pointed out that students should not have been participating in the protest as part of a field trip for reasons of safety and well-being. Then how did it happen in the first place? How was the TDSB ever convinced that one could simply observe a rally?

Don't have an account?  “The unfounded allegations that Mr. F is a sexual predator are bad enough,” Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Timothy Gabriel said. “To further add that he is a serial victimizer of Indigenous women, and carrying on this activity on his employer’s premises magnifies the already significant impact of these posts upon his reputation. For the respondent to allege that he is depraved enough to sexually assault his very young daughter, and also parade her around to his supervisors and co-workers, having her urinate in front of them for their titillation and/or amusement, is truly horrific. Finally, that Ms. A would actually name the applicant’s young daughter in these posts, and post her picture, displays absolutely no regard for decency whatsoever.” Attempting to destroy an adult’s life “is a terrible thing,” Gabriel said. “But to have so little regard for a small child (who was approximately four years old when this campaign started and undoubtedly now attends school) is incomprehensible,” said the judge. “In a very real way, Ms. A has treated this little girl as mere collateral damage in her war with Mr. F.” Get a dash of perspective along with the trending news of the day in a very readable format.

Please try again The professor took his ex to court looking for the judge to declare that her posts about him “constitute cyber bullying,” according to the decision dated Sept. 18. He also wanted Gabriel to order her to take down the posts and stop her from contacting him. The judge’s decision doesn’t name the university where he teaches, and she was a student. “The parties had a relatively short-lived relationship which began and ended in 2019,” Gabriel said. “It appears to have begun in May and was essentially over by November of that year.” The woman describes herself as “a visual artist, musician” and Inuktitut language teacher, according to the decision. The professor alleged in a May affidavit that her online harassment “has caused him significant distress, and that he fears, due to the nature of the accusations levelled against him, that he will be targeted with violence,” said the decision. “He says he has lost hair and weight, and experiences heart palpitations due to the stress and fear caused by the respondent’s harassment.” The woman has over 3,000 followers on Instagram, as well as less on other social media platforms. She admitted to labelling him a predator in her posts. “He is a predator. He just does not agree with that view. I tried to seek out help from authorities but I was not believed. So, for me, it is true he is a predator because he abused his power as a professor to take advantage of me, a single Indigenous woman and mother,” she told the court in a written affidavit. “He is using this court case to disparage me, intimidate me and continue his abusive and exploitative behaviour.” She alleged that the professor is sexually abusing his daughter at work and that he “would sexually groom his daughter in front of her,” said the decision. She posted a letter written by her lawyer repeating claims that he stalked her and forced her to have an abortion, it said. She called him a “white racist” and posted a photo of the professor with his daughter stating he is sexually abusing her, said the decision. She also made social media posts alleging the professor is violent, and that while he was earning his post-doctoral degree, his supervisor was “mysteriously pushed off a mountain and he had to get another supervisor.” Her only justification for making the comments was “that she believes them to be true,” said the judge. Gabriel had “no difficulty concluding that the electronic communications in question, made by the respondent, were not only likely to cause harm to the applicant’s health or well-being, but that they were maliciously intended to do so. It is obvious. Most of the communications in questions are grossly offensive and indecent.” Her online campaign against the professor “was as relentless as it was extensive,” said the judge. “She was motivated by malice. The timing of the postings was tied to the relationship break-up, its recommencement and its second break-up.” The judge awarded the professor $70,000 in general damages, as well as another $15,000 in punitive damages. “Many, many people all over the world are hurt every day when relationships end,” Gabriel said. “Thankfully, only an infinitesimally small number of them respond by attempting to engage in actions such as those employed by Ms. A.” He also ordered that the posts in question “be taken down and disabled immediately.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

OTTAWA — A new Statistics Canada report has found that homicides of Indigenous women and girls are less likely to result in the most serious murder charges than cases in which victims were non-Indigenous. The study, released Wednesday, looked at how homicides of Indigenous women and girls moved through the court system, and how the outcomes of those cases compared to those of non-Indigenous women and girls.

But when the victim was Indigenous, police laid or recommended that charge half as often. The less-serious offences of second-degree murder and manslaughter were more common. During that time period, StatCan found, Indigenous women and girls were killed at a rate six times higher than that of women and girls who were not Indigenous. The StatCan study said 87 per cent of homicides of Indigenous women and girls between 2009 and 2021 solved, compared to 90 per cent of cases where the victim was a non-Indigenous woman or girl. Both categories had the same conviction rate of 55 per cent. The report also said most Indigenous women and girls were found to be killed by someone they knew, and those accused in most cases were also Indigenous. We need to do better In 2019, the federal government released the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which included 231 calls to justice. Two years later, the government released a national action plan that sought to address those calls. The Native Women’s Association of Canada has been keeping track of the government’s annual performance on implementing the plan, and called Ottawa’s progress a “failure” in its most recent report. Few of the promised actions have been completed, while others have seen “marginal progress” or remain untouched, the June 2023 report says. In a joint statement on Wednesday, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree, Northern Affairs Minister Dan Vandal, Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu and Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth of Canada Marci Ien promised to improve. “For all the families, survivors, and communities living with the loss of their missing and murdered loved ones, we need to do better, and we will do better.” Speaking with reporters Wednesday morning about the StatCan report, Anandasangaree said there are issues of systemic racism within the criminal justice system. “There’s definitely a lot of work to do and I don’t think the report today should be shocking. It’s sadly part of the colonial legacy that we are trying to untangle.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion. Please keep comments relevant and respectful.

Please try again The protest was part of the Sept. 18 River Run, which culminated in the Walk for Mercury Justice, a demonstration at Queen’s Park regarding extremely high rates of mercury poisoning at the Grassy Narrows First Nation outside Kenora, Ont. But the procession had no shortage of radical elements, including  , as well as Toronto’s usual coterie of anti-Israel organizers, including the Palestinian Youth Movement, a group that has repeatedly celebrated terrorist attacks against Israel and called for the annihilation of the Jewish state. Amidst posts memorializing the Hezbollah “martyrs” killed by exploding pagers earlier this week, PYM put out an official call for its followers to join the Grassy Narrows demonstration and help “foster Indigenous resistance across Turtle Island.” (Turtle Island being a “decolonized” name often used by activists in place of the word “Canada” or “North America.”) Toronto-area MP Kevin Vuong also weighed in on the field trip during a call to AM640. “TDSB teachers lied; they lied that this would be about Grassy Narrows … they lied that they would be observing and learning – they were made to protest,” he said. Israel’s Toronto consul, Idit Shamir, similarly accused TDSB of “indoctrination.” Sorry   but this apology is not enough. The board must keep a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students, and you failed. Any rational calculation would have prevented this school trip from happening. Parents expressed their legitimate concerns and you ignored…  “Adults in keffiyehs and face coverings led the way, while young minds were subjected to a one-sided political narrative,” she wrote on social media. The TDSB said in a statement that the “educational experience” was meant to expose students to Indigenous voices. “We understand that issues beyond the main focus of this event were raised and that some students may have been negatively impacted by what they saw and heard. The TDSB was not aware that students would engage with any issues outside of the main focus of the River Run and we apologize for the harm that some students may have experienced as a result. At this time, we are supporting impacted students and their families,” the statement says. “In general, students should not be participating in organized protests as part of a field trip, and this clarification will be shared with the system. The TDSB will also be reviewing its field trip procedures to provide guidance that upholds the safety and well-being of students.” I am deeply disappointed by yesterday’s events. Compromising the security and safety of students is unacceptable.  I expect TDSB to conduct a thorough review of the situation and ensure accountability with parents and students to prevent future incidents.  The Wednesday event   from teacher’s organizations, including the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario, who sent representatives to the march and urged others to show “solidarity” with the cause. Deputizing children to participate in political causes is not unprecedented within the TDSB, if only for the fact that the Wednesday field trip is not even the first time that school children have been mobilized to take up the specific issue of Grassy Narrows. A cursory web search turns up a 2019 event at Toronto’s Mountview Alternative school where elementary school students were enlisted to write letters to the prime minister advocating for immediate action on clean drinking water at Grassy Narrows.” Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Opinion: Corporate Canada needs to guard against 'Indigenous-washing' ,Big money is now going to ,https://financialpost.com/opinion/corporate-canada-guard-against-indigenous-washing,"Big money is now going to Indigenous suppliers of goods and services.

Corporate Canada is investing tens of billions of dollars in Indigenous procurement. But with any significant investment comes the risk of fraudulent claims. Recent   that Ottawa has awarded millions of dollars in contracts to companies falsely claiming Indigenous ownership should be sending shockwaves through the business sector. If the federal government, with its elaborate oversight mechanisms and procurement rules, can be so vulnerable to manipulation, what’s stopping the same from happening in the private sector?

Corporate Canada has embraced economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. But its efforts will mean little if they are not anchored by verification. As companies commit to supporting Indigenous communities, they must ensure the businesses they partner with are, in fact, legitimate Indigenous enterprises. Not doing so may expose companies to unnecessary reputational risks, not to mention waste significant resources in ways CEOs and boards of publicly traded companies will have to explain to their shareholders. More must be done, including by the federal government, to ensure that businesses claiming to be Indigenous actually are Indigenous. Media   have revealed that businesses with absolutely no ties to Indigenous communities have simply self-identified as Indigenous-owned in procurement applications and secured lucrative government contracts. Those same reports found that billions of dollars in contracts are being awarded to Indigenous businesses without any verification. Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.

The next issue of Top Stories will soon be in your inbox. We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again We’ve already seen the damage “ ” can cause in the context of   initiatives. A company caught inflating its environmental or sustainability credentials is called out, and investors, partners and customers lose trust. The next wave of such scandals will involve companies getting caught “Indigenous-washing” — that is, claiming they’re working with Indigenous-owned businesses that turn out to be frauds. CEOs and boards need to get ahead of this issue before funds are misdirected and Indigenous communities lose out on vital economic opportunities. Failure to do so will erode efforts to achieve genuine economic reconciliation and build meaningful partnerships. One option is to work with organizations like the Canadian Council for Indigenous Business (where as a former board member I’m still involved in the partnership accreditation program). Through CCIB’s “certified Indigenous business” program, applicants provide corporate documents demonstrating 51 per cent ownership by an Indigenous person and provide proof of that person’s Indigenous status (such as a Status Card, Inuit beneficiary card, or federally recognized Métis card). Such checks should be standard operating procedure for any business claiming to be Indigenous. Historically, however, they have not been. If companies are serious about working with Indigenous partners, they should look to credible third-party validators like the CCIB to confirm the authenticity of a company’s Indigenous ownership claims. Billions of dollars are at stake, and as more corporations look to demonstrate their commitment to reconciliation, the risks only grow. Good intentions are not enough. Without verification, the whole system can be gamed, and both Indigenous communities and the businesses trying to support them will lose out. It’s not enough to take a company’s word that they’re Indigenous owned. There needs to be independent verification. By making use of third-party certifications, businesses can both ensure they’re advancing economic reconciliation and help build trust with Indigenous communities and customers. The commitments to Indigenous procurement are real and the resulting opportunities for Indigenous communities vast. But everyone involved needs to be playing by the same rules. Corporate Canada should not hesitate to ensure the legitimacy of its Indigenous partnerships, not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it’s the smart thing to do.
